### Overview
The I-White-label 3rd Party integration API allows B2B customers to integrate the sportsbook website into B2B customer’s website. B2B customer’s users will be able to access and place bets in the sportsbook system from B2B customer’s website without requiring the user to register in the sportsbook website.

There are 2 methods of integration; however, there are common endpoints between both integration methods.
For a complete understanding of the integration, please review the documents relevant to your chosen integration method:
