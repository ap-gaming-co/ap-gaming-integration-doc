# 1. Seamless Wallet Overview

The Sportsbook Platform needs to communicate with the Operator Wallet for the purposes of seamlessly debiting and crediting funds from the Operator Wallet when bets are placed and settled.

## 1.1. Architecture Overview

The SB Seamless Wallet API has been designed using a lightweight REST style web service. All requests/responses use JSON format to transfer. Thus, the header of a request/response must have a parameter `ContentType: application/json`.

## 1.2. Data Format
### 1.2.1. Common Data Format

All requests from the Sportsbook Platform to Operator Wallet API have basic information in POST request data (except [Ping API](#21-ping). Please refer to API definition).

```json
{
    // other property of POST data.
    "Timestamp": "2018-01-15T15:20:14",
    "Signature": "aTFzUoIUD7Tpclf9XQ/+kuyEkNRJCUMK12XgQoVmhKuy6HGle5pj1sdZJJ\
        +FSu23MZhy+ppH02fe3kDnB5CgMw=="
}
```
| Parameter | Type | E.g. Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Timestamp` | `Date` | 2018-01-15T15:20:14 |  |
| `Signature` | `String` |  | The signature was generated from [Authentication](/docs/shared-en.md)

### 1.2.2. Common Response Data Format

Data format for most requests.

```json
{
    "Result": {
         //... Result Object
    },
    "ErrorCode": 0,
    "Timestamp": "2018-01-15T15:20:14"
}
```


# 2. Operator Wallet API Methods

The Operator Wallet API includes the following API methods:

## 2.1. Ping

This method is used to query the Operator Wallet API to determine if the API is available. If no response is received e.g. Timeout, the Operator Wallet API will also be assumed to be unavailable.

### 2.1.1. Request Format

**Endpoint**

The request will be sent to following URI:

```yml
URI: /ping
Method: POST
```

**POST Parameters**

The API method will send post JSON in the following format:

```js
{    
    "Timestamp": "2018-01-15T15:20:14" // (Date)
}
```

### 2.1.2. Response Format

The API will return JSON in the following format:

```js
{
    "Result": {
        "Available": true   // (Boolean) wallet is available. Type: Boolean
    },
    "ErrorCode": 0,     // Refer to Possible Error Code
    "Timestamp": "2018-01-15T15:20:14"
}
```

### 2.1.3. Possible Error Code

| Code | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| -1 | Unknown Error unknown error has occurred during the API call.|
| -6 | API Authentication failed This error will be returned if the Signature is invalid or not found.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||


## 2.2. Seamless Wagering

Seamless Wagering methods help to update the balance in the Operator wallet's account in real time. This action occurs when a player places a bet, a bet is accepted, settled, or rejected. These are processes that affect the balance in the Operator wallet.

```yml
URI: /{agentcode}/wagering/usercode/{usercode}/request/{requestid}
Method: POST
```

| Parameter | E.g. Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agentcode` | `AG001` | Agent code is provided by Sportsbook Platform. |
| `usercode` | `PIN00115` | User Code is created in Create Player API. |
| `requestid` | `81347c9e-280d-40d6-8349-29dca7ea6bdc` | Request Id is unique in the betting platform. It is formatted based on UUID (8-4-4-4-12).|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||

There are 7 Action Types for a wager: `BETTED`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, `SETTLED`, `CANCELLED`, `ROLLBACKED` and `UNSETTLED`.

Note 1: If the bet was accepted with better odds and the player chose Stake as “To Win” amount, the difference must be credited back to the player account. See ACCEPTED Action section.


![Wager State Diagram](../res/wager-state-diagram-english-chinese.png?raw=true)

**Unsettled Action** 

A bet may be **Unsettled** when the outcome of the bet needs to be changed.<br/>

A bet can only be Unsettled after it has been **Settled** or **Cancelled**.<br/>

**Handling Settled and Unsettled Actions**
 
The action to take will depend on the current status of the bet, the status in the action, and the action ID. Refer to the table below:<br/>
| Status Received<br/> | Current Status<br/> | Received Action ID is Higher<br/>Action ID | Action To Take<br/>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SETTLED  | ACCEPTED | Yes | Settle the bet |
| SETTLED | UNSETTLED | No  | Ignore action  |
| SETTLED | UNSETTLED | Yes | Settle the bet |
| SETTLED | SETTLED | No | Ignore action |
| SETTLED | SETTLED | Yes | Unsettle the bet, then settle the bet |
| UNSETTLED | SETTLED | No | Ignore action |
| UNSETTLED | SETTLED | Yes | Unsettle the bet |
| UNSETTLED | UNSETTLED | No | Ignore action |
| UNSETTLED | UNSETTLED | Yes | Ignore action |

### 2.2.1. BETTED Action

When a player is placing a bet in the player site, the Sportsbook Platform sends **BETTED** action with wager information to the Operator to deduct funds from the player’s balance and to store the wager. The available Balance response is the balance after performing a transaction.

If the response received from the BETTED action is invalid or incomplete, the Sportsbook Platform will send a ROLLBACKED action as we cannot be certain that the wager information was successfully processed by the Operator.

**Parlay & Teaser Wager Type: POST Data for Request**

A Round Robin bet is an easy way to wager multiple parlays with a single bet. They make it easy for bettors to place parlay wagers that consist of 3-8 lines. A parlay without Round Robin can consist of up to 10 lines and 2-6 teams for a teaser. Bettors can cover their bases and wager all possible combinations by using a Round Robin and bet many parlays at once. The downside to these wagers is that gamblers bet too many legs or use too many selections in their parlay combinations. You can find round robin bets at just about every online sportsbook, but they are not often used by most sports gamblers.

Operators receive request BETTED action when the player places a bet. A Round Robin will be presented through RoundRobinOptions. Its value can be `Single`, `Parlay` (not a round robin. It is only normal parlay wager), `TwoLegRoundRobin`, `ThreeLegRoundRobin`, `FourLegRoundRobin`, `FiveLegRoundRobin`, `SixLegRoundRobin`, `SixLegRoundRobin`, `SevenLegRoundRobin`, `EightLegRoundRobin`.

The example table shows a combination of picks (events/legs) and round robin options:

*Table 1 - Combination of picks (events/legs) and round robin options*

| Picks <br/>(events/legs/bets)  | Ways<br/>| Number of Bets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 2 - TwoLegRoundRobin| 3 |
| 4 | 2 - TwoLegRoundRobin< | 6 |
| 4 | 3 - ThreeLegRoundRobin | 4 |
| … | … | … |
| … | … | … |
| 8 | 2 - TwoLegRoundRobin | 28 |
| 8 | 3 - ThreeLegRoundRobin | 56 |
| 8 | 4 - FourLegRoundRobin | 70 |
| 8 | 5 - FiveLegRoundRobin | 56 |
| 8 | 6 - SixLegRoundRobin | 28 |

We send to operators 1 `BETTED` action when a player places a bet with a Round Robin Parlay. The wager in this action is *master wager*. Then we send 3 `ACCEPTED` action if player bet in 3 events (games, matches) and `RoundRobinOptions` is `TwoLegRoundRobin` (assuming that the player’s bet was accepted). Other actions are also the same (`ACCEPTED` action). The `WagerMasterId` property will used to group all wagers together.

Events of WagerInfo for Parlay / Teaser Wager will be presented in a list containing event names.

In `BETTED` action, we send the number of bets that will be generated using the `WagerNum` property in JSON request. When the bet is accepted, we will send the number of `ACCEPTED` actions equal to number in the `WagerNum` property. The same will happen for the next action type.

### 2.2.4. REJECTED Action

### 2.2.6. ROLLBACKED Actions

If a response is not received from the server, a timeout (499), gateway error (502, 504), or an invalid response is received, on sending a BETTED action, a ROLLBACKED action will be sent for the wager. The Operator must rollback the wager using the WagerId and refund the Amount that Sportsbook Platform sent in betted action using the TransactionId. If the Transaction and Wager are not found in Operator side, no adjustment is to be made.

*Note: The rollback action will be sent when there is a problem during the bet placement process. Request includes wager information and transaction type of “rollbacked”. This request has only 1 action and does not include other actions.*

In the Transaction of Rollback action, we send a ReferTransactionId property. This refers to TransactionId of the previous BETTED action. The ROLLBACKED action helps to identify transactions from the BETTED action. Sometimes the Operator will get this action but no previous BETTED action (e.g. there may be a problem sending BETTED actions over the network). Please ignore it and respond as a success with ResponseCode is 0 as data.

### 2.2.7. UNSETTLED Action

When a bet needs to be resettled due to an incorrect result or any other reason that may cause the resettlement in Sportsbook Platform. The Sportsbook Platform will send UNSETTLED action to reverse the previous settle operation. The Operator must refund the lost amount or take back the win amount and change wager status back to OPEN.

*Note: The action following an Unsettled action is either Cancelled or Settled. In this request data, we usually call the Operator in 2 actions: `UNSETTLED` then `CANCELLED`/`SETTLED`.*
